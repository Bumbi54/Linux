Be careful of letter case of commands you type. DATE != date
SILENT COMMANDS:
  -silent commands don't return output in command prompt if they are successful
  -returns something is they failed

UNIX consider both directories and ordinary files as a file, so some commands work for both.

Commands can be used arguments that begin with hyphen for different results/behavior. Such argument is called "opinion".

User can write file with commands that he want to run and then run all commands in that file with "sh".

Division:
  -kernel
    Interacts with machine's hardware
    Bootstrap program loads it into a memory
    Written in C
    User programs that need to communitate with hardware do it over set of function called system calls
    It manages memory, processes and other.
  -shell
    Interacts with user
    Interface between user and kernel.
    One for each user who is currently logged in

  The kernel is represented by the file /boot/vmlinuz. The shells are in /bin and /usr/bin.

  Files have places and processes have life.
    Directories and devices are considered files.

Commands are usually represented as disk files that contains executable programs:
  -internal: this commands are not disks files, for example "cd"
  -external: this commands are disk files

General commands are located in:
  /bin
  /user/bin
Commands for graphical output are located in:
  /usr/X11R6/bin
  /usr/dt/bin
Commands used by system administrator re located in:
  /sbin
  /usr/sbin

Commands:
  Arguments that start with hyphen (-) are called "options".
  Filenames are generally last arguments in command line (not always).

To write multiple commands in single line use delimiter ";".

Man command output:
  -If a command argument is enclosed in rectangular brackets, then it is optional;
    otherwise, the argument is required. The wc man page shows all its arguments
    enclosed in three such groups. This means that wc can be used without arguments.
  -The ellipsis (a set of three dots) implies that there can be more instances of the
    preceding word. The expression [ file ... ] signifies that wc can be used with
    more than one filename as argument.
  -If you find a | (pipe) character in any of these areas, it means that only one of the
    options shown on either side of the pipe can be used. Here, only one of the options,
    -c, -m and -C, can be used.

Password of users are stored in:
  /etc/shadow
